nvram -- A tool to operate on extended nvram most modern PC chipsets offer.

Other copyleft (GPL) holders:
* nvram was developed using Sergei Haller's observations how the different
  kinds of nvram are connected in the PC. Sergei Haller developed a program
  "nvram-wakeup", which manipulates the nvram to set a wakeup time
  in a modern PC's BIOS. However, Sergei had misunderstood some things about
  the Dallas DS1685, so I had to correct more than I learned...
* The list.h implementation was made from the Linux kernel's one at
  /usr/include/linux/list.h.
